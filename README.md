About Me :
Hey! I'm Neha L.K. Arya, the developer of this website based in Dehradun,India :3 
I'm 17 years old(af of June,2025)and I love to code cutesy websites and games whenever i get time. 
I watched my first Studio Ghibli movie during the Covid-19 pandemic when i was 12 years old and i've been completely in love ever since.
If i recall correctly my first Ghibli movie was Spirited Away which is why i definitely had to put that movie here.
As of now i've watched almost all of Studio Ghibli but i keep revisiting old ones bcs it brings me joy and its super comforting :D .


Why I made this website ?
I know its hard to get your parents to subscribe to Netflix and Prime Video when they aren't interested in movies and web-series.
But i know you wanna watch(or rewatch!) all your favourite Ghibli Movies ;D That's why i bring to you a website where you can find all your fav Ghibli movies and stream them for absolutely free!! 
There is absolutely no fuss in this website. This website is also made as a tribute to Studio Ghibli and (Lord)Hayao Miyazaki.
I will put all the gud stuff about Ghibli here and i hope to keep adding All movies on this website.


HOPE YOU ENJ0YY !

Tech Stuff?
This website was made on VS Code using HTML AND CSS and the tiniest bit of JS for the colourful sprinkles you see on the home page.
Took around 6 hours to build and is one of my first websites.
My dumbahh tried to use git lfs to upload whole 2 hr movies on the website and i failed miserably, also got a big bug in VS Code due to tht and was not able to push anything for a whole day.
Used my brain a little and did a picture-in-picture thingy from another website :the internet archive, which is allowed to publish such stuff ig?
it was wayyy easier and my website wont take 999hours to load now. This should be legal bcs the movies arent hosted on my website but are basically just a link to another website which is alaso free.
Now....
If for some reason it is illegal...
PLEASE DONT REPORT /BAN ME . Just tell me and i'll take it down :(
