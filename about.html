             <h3>About Me :</h3>
             <p>Hey! I'm Neha L.K. Arya, the developer of this website based in Dehradun,India :3 I'm 17 years old(af of June,2025)and I love to
                code cutesy websites and games whenever i get time. I watched my first Studio Ghibli movie 
                during the Covid-19 pandemic when i was 12 years old and i've been completely in love ever since.
                If i recall correctly my first Ghibli movie was Spirited Away which is why i definitely had to
            put that movie here. As of now i've watched almost all of Studio Ghibli but i keep revisiting old ones
        bcs it brings me joy and its super comforting :D .             </p>

        <h3>Why I made this website ?</h3>
            <p>I know its hard to get your parents to subscribe to Netflix and Prime Video when they aren't interested
                in movies and web-series. But i know you wanna watch(or rewatch!) all your favourite Ghibli Movies ;D 
                That's why i bring to you a website where you can find all your fav Ghibli movies and stream them for absolutely free!!
                There is absolutely no fuss in this website. This website is also made as a tribute to Studio Ghibli
                and (Lord)Hayao Miyazaki. I will put all the gud stuff about Ghibli here and i hope to keep adding All
                movies on this website.</p>
